# Software-Testing

The purpose of this project was to gain experience on applying the black-box and white-box
testing techniques discussed in Software Testing Course, as well as creating automated test code with JUnit. My task
was to create a test suite in JUnit, produce bug reports (if any). I have used the Borg Calendar application source code from : https://github.com/mikeberger/borg_calendar/releases
