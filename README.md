# Software-Testing

The purpose of this project was to gain experience on applying the black-box and white-box
testing techniques discussed in Software Testing Course, as well as creating automated test code with JUnit. My task
was to create a test suite in JUnit, produce bug reports (if any). I have used the Borg Calendar application source code from : https://github.com/mikeberger/borg_calendar/releases

# Black-box Testing with JUnit: 
My task here was to create a test suite in JUnit using the black-box testing techniques, produce bug
reports. Select three methods from the system. The methods must be chosen so that I can
demonstrate the application of the three testing techniques: boundary value testing,
equivalence class testing, and decision table testing. It is okay to use a combination of testing
techniques, but each technique must be used at least once


# White-box Testing with JUnit:
Based on the coverage results from thr Black-Box Testing, added more test cases to my test suite to bring the code coverage of
my selected methods as close as possible to 100%
